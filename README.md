# Sportsduniya

This project is a web-based application that displays a list of colleges along with their key details such as Collegedunia rating, fees, user review rating, and placement information. The table includes features like sorting, searching, and infinite scrolling to make it easy for users to explore the data. Additionally, users can apply to colleges or download brochures directly from the table.
